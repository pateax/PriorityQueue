# PriorityQueue
A priority queue implementation using an array representation of a binary heap data structure. This is a minimum binary heap which means the smallest key is found at the root of the tree. The priority queue supports the following methods: offer(E e), add(E e), poll(), remove(), peek(), element(), size(), toString(), and toTree(). See the java file for more details on each method.
